# Android-Retrofit-REST-Demo

In this demo project I created an app to access data on a WampServer. The server db contains one table "users" currently. 
I wrote the server-side APIs in php. The app uses the Retrofit REST client to do (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) actions on the table, and can post user-entries with pictures (optional). This demo project is a foundation for a future app I plan to gradually build with the help of  projects I have in my Github repositories.
