# Android-Retrofit-REST-Demo

In this demo project I created an app to access data on a WampServer. The server db which contains one table "users" currently. The "users" table contains user-entries with picture (optional). 
I wrote the server-side APIs in php. The app uses the Retrofit REST client to do (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) actions on the table. 
This demo project is a foundation base for a future app I plan to gradually build using projects I have to Github repositories.
