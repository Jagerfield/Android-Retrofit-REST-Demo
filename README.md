# Android-Retrofit-REST-Demo (work in progress)

In this demo project I created an app to access data on a WampServer. The server db contains one table "users" currently. 
I wrote the server-side APIs in php. The app uses the Retrofit REST client to do GET, POST (and eventuqally PUT, DELETE) actions on the table, and post user-entries with pictures (optional). 

# Project Goal
This demo project is a foundation for a future app I plan to gradually build. The app will enable users to share their expensis.

The following will be implemented:
1- Verify phone number using Facebook Account Kit.
2- Use Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for push nitifications.
3- Develop the backend, that includes database tables and RESTful Web Service in PHP.
